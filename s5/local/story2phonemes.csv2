001,Once upon a time there was a young rat named Arthur who couldn't make up his mind Whenever the other rats asked him if he would like to go out hunting with them he would answer in a soft voice I don't know And when they said Would you rather stay inside? he wouldn't say yes or no either He'd always avoid making a choice,w6ns @pOn @ tAem De: w@z @ j6N r\{t n{Imd 6:T@ h}: kUd@nt m{Ik 6p hIz mAend wenev@ Di: 6D@ r\{ts 6:skt hIm If hi: w@d lAek t@ g@} {Ot h6ntIN wIT Dem hi: w@d {ns@r\ In @ sOft voIs Ae d@}nt n@} @n wen D{I sed wUd j@ r\6:D@ st{I InsAed hi: wUd@nt s{I jes o: n@} i:D@ hi:d o:lw{Iz @voId m{IkIN @ tSoIs
002,One fine day his aunt Zelda appealed to him Now look here No one is going to care about you if you carry on like this You have no more mind of your own than a greasy old blade of grass Arthur coughed and looked wise as usual but said nothing Don't you think so? said Zelda stamping her foot for she couldn't bear to see the poor little rat so coldblooded I don't know was all he ever answered and then he'd walk off to think for an hour or more about whether he would stay in his hole in the ground or go up into the loft,w6n fAen d{I hIz 6:nt zeld@ @pi:ld t@ hIm n{O lUk hI@ n@} w6n Iz g@}IN t@ ke:r\ @b{Ot j}: If j@ k{r\i: On lAek Dis j}: h{v n@} mo: mAend @v j@r\ @}n D@n @ gr\i:zi: @}ld bl{Id @v gr\6:s 6:T@ kOft @n lUkt wAez @z j}:Z}:@l b@t sed n6TIN d@}nt j}: TINk s@} sed zeld@ st{mpIN h@ fUt f@ Si: kUd@nt be: t@ si: D@ po: lIt@l r\{t s@} k@}lbl6d@d Ae d@}nt n@} w@z o:l hi: ev@ {ns@d @n Den hi:d wo:k Of t@ TINk f@r\ @n {O@r\ o: mo: @b{Ot weD@ hi: w@d st{I In hIz h@}l In D@ gr\{Ond o: g@} 6p Int@ D@ lOft
003,One night the rats heard a loud noise They lived in a very dark and dreary old place The roof let the rain come washing in making shallow pools on the muddy floor The beams and rafters were all rotten through so eventually the whole structure was quite unsafe At last one of the joists gave way and the beams fell down The walls shook and the ceiling collapsed with a loud bang The rats shrieked and their fur stood on end with fear and horror This won't do said their leader with a scowl We can't stay cooped up here any longer So he sent out scouts to search for a new home,w6n nAet D@ r\{ts h3:d @ l{Od noIz D{I lIvd In @ ver\i: d6:k @n dr\I@r\i: @}ld pl{Is D@ r\}:f let D@ r\{In k6m wOSIN In m{IkIN S{l@} p}:lz On D@ m6di: flo: D@ bi:mz @n r\6:ft@z w@r\ o:l r\Ot@n Tr\}: s@} @ventS@li: D@ h@}l str\6ktS@ w@z kwAet 6ns{If {t l6:st w6n @v D@ dZoIsts g{Iv w{I {n D@ bi:mz fel d{On D@ wo:lz SUk {n D@ si:lIN k@l{pst wIT @ l{Od b{N D@ r\{ts Sr\i:kt @n De: f3: stUd On end wIT fI@r\ @n hOr\@ Dis w@}nt d}: sed De: li:d@ wIT @ sk{Ol wi: k6:nt st{I k}:pt 6p hI@ eni: lONg@ s@} hi: sent {Ot sk{Ots t@ s3:tS f@r\ @ nj}: h@}m
004,A little later on in the evening they came back having found an old fashioned barn near a stone house where there would be room board and food for all of them There they saw a kindly mare named Alberta a cow and some birds in the garden with an elm tree in the middle The leader gave the order at once Company fall in The rats crawled out of their holes right away and the sad mob stood on the floor in a long line,@ lIt@l l{It@r\ On In Di: i:vnIN D{I k{Im b{k h{vIN f{Ond @n @}ld f{S@nd b6:n nI@r\ @ st@}n h{Os we: De: w@d bi: r\}:m bo:d {nd f}:d f@r\ o:l @v Dem De: D{I so: @ kAendli: me: n{Imd {lb3:t@ @ k{O {n s@m b3:dz In D@ g6:d@n wIT @n elm tr\i: In D@ mId@l D@ li:d@ g{Iv Di: o:d@r\ @t w6ns k6mp@ni: fo:l In D@ r\{ts kr\o:ld {Ot @v De: h@}lz r\Aet @w{I {n D@ s{d mOb stUd On D@ flo:r\ In @ lON lAen
005,Just then the old rat caught sight of young Arthur He wasn't in the line and he wasn't exactly outside it; he stood just nearby ears pricked Come on get in line growled the old rodent unamused You are coming too arent you? I don't know said Arthur calmly Why the idea of it You don't think it's safe here anymore do you? I'm not certain said Arthur undaunted The roof may not fall down yet Well said the old rat you would be stupid not to join us Then he turned to the assembled group and shouted Right about face March and the long line marched out of the barn while the young rat watched them,dZ6st Den Di: @}ld r\{t ko:t sAet @v j6N 6:T@ hi: wOz@nt In D@ lAen {n hi: wOz@nt egz{ktli: {OtsAed @t hi: stUd dZ6st nI@bAe I@z pr\Ikt k6m On get In lAen gr\{Old Di: @}ld r\@}d@nt 6n@mj}:zd j}: 6: k6mIN t}: 6:nt j}: Ae d@}nt n@} sed 6:T@ k6:mli: wAe Di: AedI@r\ @v @t j}: d@}nt TINk Its s{If hI@ eni:mo: d}: j}: Aem nOt s3:t@n sed 6:T@ 6ndo:nt@d D@ r\}:f m{I nOt fo:l d{On jet wel sed Di: @}ld r\{t j}: wUd bi: stj}:p@d nOt t@ dZoIn @s Den hi: t3:nd t@ Di: @semb@ld gr\}:p @n S{Ot@d r\Aet @b{Ot f{Is m6:tS {nd D@ lON lAen m6:tSt {Ot @v D@ b6:n wAel D@ j6N r{t wOtSt Dem/

007,But during the night there was a big crash Down came beams rafters joists the whole business in a pile of rubble Next morning there was a foggy dew Some boys and girls ran to the barn and a man in boots came to view the damage It seemed odd that the old building was not haunted by rats But at last one of the children happened to nudge a board and he saw a puny rat quite dead tail half in and half out of his hole Thus the coward got his due and there was no mourning for him,b@t dZ}:r\IN D@ nAet De: w@z @ bIg kr\{S d{On k{Im bi:mz r\6:ft@z dZoIsts D@ h@}l bIzn@s In @ pAel @v r\6b@l neks mo:nIN De: w@z @ fOgi: dZ}: s@m boIz @n g3:lz r\{n t@ D@ b6:n {nd @ m{n in b}:ts k{Im t@ vj}: D@ d{mIdZ It si:md Od D@t Di: @}ld bIldIN w@z nOt ho:nt@d bAe r\{ts b@t @t l6:st w6n @v D@ tSIldr\@n h{p@nd t@ n6dZ @ bo:d {n hi: so: @ pj}:ni: r\{t kwAet ded t{Il h6:f In @n h6:f {Ot @v hIz h@}l D6s D@ k{O@d gOt hIz dZ}: @n De: w@z n@} mo:nIN f@r\ hIm
